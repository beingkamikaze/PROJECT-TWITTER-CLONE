# Twitter Clone MERN App

## Project Description

This Twitter Clone web application was developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with a primary focus on security, real-time communication, and advanced social interaction features. The application enables users to create accounts, post tweets (text and images), follow/unfollow other users, like, comment, and engage in chat conversations using Socket.io.

## Key Features

### User Authentication

- Implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication for secure login and signup processes.
- Utilized bcrypt for password encryption and decryption to ensure user data security.

### User Profiles

- Users can set up profiles with profile pictures, usernames, and bio information.
- Profile pictures can be updated and changed.

### Tweeting

- Users can create and publish tweets, including both text and images.
- Tweets are displayed in a feed, sorted by most recent.

### Social Interactions

- Users can follow/unfollow other users to create a personalized feed.
- They can like, comment on, and reply to tweets.
- React to tweets with emojis or custom reactions.

### Real-time Chat

- Implemented Socket.io for real-time chat functionality.
- Users can initiate private conversations with other users.
- Real-time message updates and notifications.

### Light and Dark Mode

- Provided users with the option to switch between light and dark mode for a personalized experience.

### User Search

- Users can search for other users by their usernames.
- Search results display relevant user profiles.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- React.js for the user interface.
- Redux or Context API for state management.
- Styled-components or CSS for styling.

### Backend

- Node.js with Express.js for the server.
- MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose as the ODM.
- JWT for authentication and authorization.
- Socket.io for real-time chat.

## Challenges

- Implementing real-time chat functionality with Socket.io.
- Ensuring data security and authentication.
- Optimizing the application for performance, especially in handling media (images).

## Project Outcome

The Twitter Clone MERN application successfully replicates core Twitter features while incorporating real-time chat and advanced social interaction features. It provides a secure and interactive platform for users to share thoughts, engage with others, and have private conversations.
